## Launch_Pad_1

### Description 

The goal of this assignment was to use a for loop to make a rasberry pie serial moniter countdown from 10 and then say liftoff. 

### Evidence

### Code

[Launch Pad 1 Code](raspberry-pi/Launch_1.py )

### Reflection 

The main thing I needed help on for this assignment was how to make thew for function count down instead of up. I needed to change the last value of the for function and make it -1 to count down instead of 1 to count up.

## Launch_Pad_2

### Description 

The goal of of this assignment was to add on to the code used in the previous assignment and make a LED flash green everytime it counted down and make another LED flash red when it got to liftoff.

### Code

### Wiring

### Reflection 

The one thing that I was stuck on was how to make two seperate LEDs so the green can blink seperatly from the red. You have to make a led1 and led2 to make this work.

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
